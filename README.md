# OTP 20 evaluation script

A script that iterates over a riak branch and pulls out stats

# Purpose

To enable an estimate for the upgrade of riak to OTP20/rebar3 to be done based on the existing work that Ted Burghart did at Basho

The stats assembled reflected the key themes of the partial upgrade work already done.
